  You come to me and you ask for a review.

  You ask without respect. You offer no credentials. You did not even
  think to make a key. The Commission does not sit for free, and it
  does not sit for strangers.

  Make the key. Then we talk.

{rule}

  1. Generate a Bedrock API key — the short way in, no IAM console,
     no roles to assume:

       https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock  →  API keys  →  Generate

     ⚠ When it asks about permissions, grant **AmazonBedrockFullAccess**.
       The narrower default lets the key authenticate and then refuses
       every model call, which looks like a broken tool rather than a
       missing permission. This is the step people get wrong.

  2. Put it where this tool will find it. Either export it:

       export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=ABSK...
       export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

     or write those two lines into ~/.grumpy.env and forget about it —
     that file is read automatically and never overrides a real
     environment variable:

       printf 'export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=ABSK...\n'\
              'export AWS_REGION=us-east-1\n' > ~/.grumpy.env
       chmod 600 ~/.grumpy.env

     Long-lived credentials work too: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, an AWS_PROFILE, or an instance role.

  3. Enable the models. Access is off by default, granted per account
     and per region, and this is separate from the key's permissions:

       https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock  →  Model access
                                              →  Modify model access

     Enable at least two vendors besides the one you write code with.
     Some are region-locked or country-locked; Bedrock will say so.

  4. Confirm the whole chain before trusting it:

       grumpy doctor

{rule}
"""

ACCESS_DENIED = """
{rule}

  The key is good. The door is not open.

  Your credentials authenticated. The models did not answer. There are
  exactly two reasons for that, and they are fixed in different places:

  1. The key lacks permission.
     A Bedrock API key generated with the narrow default can call
     almost nothing. Reissue it with **AmazonBedrockFullAccess**, or
     attach that policy to the IAM identity you are using:

       https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock  →  API keys

  2. The models are not enabled in this account and region.
     Bedrock ships with model access switched off. It is granted per
     account, per region, and some models are restricted by country:

       https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock  →  Model access
                                              →  Modify model access

  Then:

       grumpy models      # what this account and region will serve
       grumpy doctor      # whether your configured models answer

  Put the ids that work into .grumpy.yml. A Commission drawn from one
  vendor is not a Commission — models that share a vendor share their
  blind spots, and their agreement is not evidence of anything.
